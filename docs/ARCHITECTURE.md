## Browser Lifecycle

1. **Launch**: `BrowserManager` creates a Patchright persistent browser context at `browser_data/` (or `browser_data_claude/`). This preserves cookies, login state, and Cloudflare clearance across restarts.

2. **DNS Pre-resolution (Docker only)**: Chrome's DNS resolver can fail inside Docker. The entrypoint script pre-resolves `chatgpt.com`, `cdn.oaistatic.com`, `claude.ai`, and related domains via Python's socket module and writes them to `/etc/hosts`. The browser also gets `--host-resolver-rules` flags.

3. **Navigate**: Opens the provider URL with retry logic (up to 5 attempts with exponential backoff).

4. **Stealth (deferred)**: Stealth patches are applied *after* first navigation to avoid breaking DNS. See the stealth section below.

5. **Login Check**: `ensure_logged_in()` checks for login indicators (chat input presence) and prompts if needed.

6. **Client Injection**: The provider client is created and injected into all API routers.

7. **Shutdown**: Browser closes gracefully on FastAPI shutdown.

## Stealth and Anti-Detection

The gateway uses multiple techniques to avoid bot detection:

| Technique | How | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent Chrome profile | `launch_persistent_context()` retains cookies and Cloudflare clearance | `browser/manager.py` |
| playwright-stealth | Patches `navigator.webdriver`, WebGL, canvas, plugins | `browser/stealth.py` |
| Docker stealth workaround | Uses `page.evaluate()` instead of `add_init_script()` (the latter breaks DNS in Docker) | `browser/stealth.py` |
| Human-like typing | `keyboard.insert_text()` for paste-style input on contenteditable divs | `browser/human.py` |
| Mouse simulation | Hover before click, natural movement | `browser/human.py` |
| Random delays | 500-1200ms before typing, 300-600ms before sending | `browser/human.py` |
| Viewport jitter | +/- 20px randomization on each launch (1280x720 base) | `browser/manager.py` |
| Headful mode | Always runs with visible browser (headless is trivially detected) | `config.py` |
| Lock file cleanup | Auto-cleans stale `SingletonLock` files from crashed Chrome processes | `browser/manager.py` |

### Docker DNS Fix

`playwright-stealth`'s `add_init_script()` method causes Chrome to fail DNS resolution inside Docker containers. The fix in `stealth.py` uses `page.evaluate()` to inject stealth JS at runtime, and hooks `framenavigated` + `page` events to re-inject on every navigation.

## Message Flow

```
send_message(text, image_paths, file_paths)
|
|-- 1. Count existing assistant messages (pre_count)
|-- 2. Random delay (500-1200ms, human simulation)
|-- 3. Upload files if any
|      +-- set_input_files() on hidden <input type="file">
|      +-- Wait 3s + extra per file for processing
|-- 4. Find chat input via selector fallback
|-- 5. Paste text via keyboard.insert_text()
|-- 6. Random delay (300-600ms)
|-- 7. Click send button (or fallback to Enter key)
|-- 8. Wait for response completion (detector)
|-- 9. Sleep 1s for DOM to settle
|-- 10. Check for DALL-E images (ChatGPT only)
|-- 11. Extract response text
|       |-- Image response: DOM scraping
|       +-- Text response: copy button click
+-- 12. Return ChatResponse(message, thread_id, elapsed_ms, images)
```

---

## Response Detection

The detector (`detector.py`) uses multiple strategies to know when the model finishes responding:

### Primary: Copy Button

The copy button only appears after the full response is generated. The detector waits for a copy button on the Nth assistant message (where N = expected count).

### Fallback: Stop Button Lifecycle

While streaming, a "Stop generating" button is visible. The detector watches for it to appear then disappear.

### Fallback: Text Stability

If neither button is found, the detector polls the last assistant message text. If it stays the same for 4+ consecutive checks (2s apart), the response is considered complete.

### Message Counting

Counts both `div[data-message-author-role='assistant']` (ChatGPT) and provider-specific elements. Image responses use different selectors than text responses.

---

## Tool Calling

The web UIs don't have native tool-calling APIs. CatGPT implements tool calling via prompt engineering.

### Flow

1. **Tool definitions** from the OpenAI request are converted into a system prompt describing each function's name, description, and parameter schema.

2. The system prompt instructs the model to output tool calls as structured JSON:
   ```json
   {"tool_calls": [{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"city": "Paris"}}]}
   ```

3. The prompt includes examples and rules:
   - Output ONLY the JSON code block when calling tools
   - No commentary before or after the JSON
   - When tool results come back, summarize naturally in plain text

4. **JSON extraction** uses a robust brace-depth tracker (not regex) that handles arbitrarily nested objects, arrays, and escaped strings.

5. Parsed tool calls are returned in standard OpenAI format with generated `call_` IDs.

6. **`tool_choice` support**:
   - `"auto"` (default): model decides whether to use tools
   - `"required"`: prompt says "you MUST call at least one tool"
   - `"none"`: tool prompt is not injected at all
   - `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"X"}}`: prompt says "you MUST call function X"

### Provider-Specific Prompts

- **Claude**: Uses collaborative framing ("You have access to external tools through a structured interface"). Avoids patterns that Claude's web UI flags as prompt injection.
- **ChatGPT**: Uses direct instruction ("You are in tool-calling mode").

### Multi-Turn Tool Calls

When tool results come back as `ToolMessage`s, the gateway builds a prompt transcript showing what was called and what was returned. Each result names its tool and call id. The model either answers or, if more work is needed, calls another tool, so multi-step agent loops work; it is told never to repeat a call that already returned its result. In `auto` mode the final protocol reminder is appended on every turn; forced/required modes append it before the first tool result, then tell the model to answer.

## File and Image Upload

```
API Request (with image_url / file content parts)
|
|-- _extract_image_urls(content)           --> list of URLs/data-URLs
|-- _extract_file_attachments(content)     --> list of {filename, data_b64, mime_type}
|
|-- _download_file(url_or_dict)            --> local file path
|   |-- data: URL       --> base64 decode, save to /tmp/catgpt_files/
|   |-- http: URL       --> download via urllib
|   |-- dict             --> base64 decode with original filename
|   +-- local path       --> pass through
|
|-- image_paths + file_paths --> client.send_message(..., image_paths=, file_paths=)
|
+-- client._upload_files(all_paths)
    |-- Find <input type="file"> via selector
    |-- set_input_files(valid_paths)
    +-- Wait 3s + 1s per additional file
```

---

## Echo Detection and Recovery

Sometimes the copy-button extraction grabs the sent prompt instead of the response (race condition). The gateway detects and recovers:

1. Check if `response_text` contains known markers from the injected tool prompt (`"Available functions:"`, `"tool-calling mode"`, etc.)
2. If echo detected, wait 3 seconds and retry `extract_last_response_via_copy()`
3. If retry still echoes, strip the system prompt prefix and extract the tail content

---

## Selector Fallback System

All DOM selectors are defined as lists of fallbacks tried in order:

```python
CHAT_INPUT = [
    "#prompt-textarea",                                    # Primary
    "div[contenteditable='true'][id='prompt-textarea']",   # Specific
    "div[contenteditable='true']",                         # Broad fallback
]
```

When Claude or ChatGPT update their UI, only `selectors.py` needs changes. The `_find_selector()` method tries each selector with a short timeout and returns the first match.

Each provider has its own selectors file:
- `src/selectors.py` (ChatGPT selectors)
- `src/claude/selectors.py` (Claude selectors)

---

## Provider Abstraction

The gateway supports multiple providers through parallel client implementations:

```
src/chatgpt/
|-- client.py       ChatGPTClient(send_message, new_chat, ...)
|-- detector.py     ChatGPT-specific response detection
|-- selectors.py    (uses src/selectors.py)
|-- image_handler.py  DALL-E image detection
+-- models.py

src/claude/
|-- client.py       ClaudeClient(send_message, new_chat, ...)
|-- detector.py     Claude-specific response detection
+-- selectors.py    Claude DOM selectors
```

Both clients expose the same interface. The API layer (`openai_routes.py`) uses `Config.PROVIDER` to select the appropriate client at startup. Provider-specific logic (tool prompts, response parsing, image generation) is handled with simple `if Config.PROVIDER == "claude"` branches.
